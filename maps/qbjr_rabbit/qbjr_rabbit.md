# credit

- track255 by me, made in OpenMPT
  - sounds from [msx.horse](https://msx.horse/)
  - also used a 'footstep on wood' sound from the original Sam & Max 100 series games
- some sfx from Half Life
- most textures by Makkon
  - some textures modified by me (in 2022)
- foliage textures from the quake discord
- water textures from liquids.WAD via https://www.quaddicted.com/files/wads/
- skybox = Overcast https://gamebanana.com/mods/380496
  - converted to .PNG in VIDE, then to .TGA in IrfanView (this was done in 2022 during the original QBJ)

# notes, changes

- WADs were updated to the modern Makkon concrete textures
- fixed the softlocks on Skill 0
- some minor geo/brushwork changes
- refactored all the entities (enemies, weapons, armor, ammo, etc)
- altered some secrets
- there is a bug present where you will end up with more kills than the max kill count. you might see 257/250 kills. i think this is a bug with the mod? or something? i don't know how to fix it, at least
