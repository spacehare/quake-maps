## lobotomy lobster - skill 2

- needs more nail ammo on post-rink-1 ice pillar for the scrags

### quote

I had a lot of difficulty with this map, I died a ton of times and it took me about 30 mins in total to get through it. I was pretty confused on what to do in several of the rooms and the way I solved a lot of them was pretty ugly

ran out of ammo a lot. I can see what the map is going for with having a small amount of ammo and enemies and lots of ice, but I mostly just found myself dying then using the axe lots to ration ammo and doing lots of circle strafing. Admittedly I was playing on hard so maybe the challenge is beyond me, but it felt like more of a tedious challenge rather than one to rise to

movement areas work fine, though my abilities with RM's movement mechanics are pretty poor so I struggled on some obstacles, particularly ones where you have to jump off ladders. There are a few obstacles where I didn't see what I needed to do until I'd activated the starting gate once or twice, which broke my flow a bit

all the basics are fine, route of progression is pretty obvious and I didn't see any bugs or anything technically wrong

## pulsar - skill 1

- > PuLSaR: there's an error about no sound in noise, edict 111
- unclear that the water is intended to be cold and thus harmful -- suggestion by player is to "show that it's not the usual water"
  - the water in the cave doesn't have to be harmful tbh. i could have it be regular water. and then have the outside water be like, cyan or something like in Spyro or RaC
- player says: intro fight (enforcer, dogs) is too hard and not fun. i agree.
- "transparent ice over the transparent water looks like the ice is under the water"
- ice rink 1
  - "this was fun!"
  - a lil more hp before the fight might be good?
  - they feel it's unfair that they can't see the ice atop the pillar in the little lake
    - i could maybe make it not ice?
  - they desire a shortcut to rink 2 after beating rink 1. maybe the door that hides the fiends could function as such? i don't know if i want to add a shortcut in the first place though.
- on skill 1, rink 2 isn't so bad? if you miss any shots you might be fucked though. needs some slack
- desires checkpoints (teleport destinations, or maybe hookpillars) in thin-ice room
- r: add an autosave before the ogre after the speedrun room
- "gimme a regular shotgun please" my baddddd
- struggles in courtyard during grate-to-grate jump over the water
  - the water is also a softlock if you fall in

## wons - skill 2

- cave slime should be water
- be mindful of grid textures beneath trampolines -- blends in
- health before ice rink 1
- to be honest maybe remove the enforcer in the courtyard entirely. don't even replace him.
- player likes ice rink 1 encounter. "simple and Doom-y"
- suggests wiremesh under bonus nails in ice rink 1 lake
- suggests secret above rink 1 lake (in the toothy above-gate area)
- likes the small encounters (ice rink, ice pillar)
  - (i assume not the enforcer + dogs)
- rink 2 needs more ammo
- while struggling with some platforming: "go ahead and skip ahead" hahaha XD
- dislikes general ammo scarcity
- likes rocket/grenade ammo scarcity
- overall enjoys the encounters

## mopey bloke - skill 2 (vkQuake)

rabbit\*.dem

- player: spawn cave water looks harmless
- hesitant to melee fight with dogs
- "it's hard to get used to the ice physics" yep
- ammo is REALLY TIGHT during the scrag fight in the first ice rink, and that's with grabbing the bonus nails below the rink
- laser-wall OFF sfx is quiet
- you can skip the 4 corners room if you airstrafe. i like this skip.
- "just make it water" -- the courtyard pool jump. this player struggles with it too.

# general notes

- fix black surfaces on shamblerTroll doors
- make scripts
  - force enemy skins
  - remove ammo backpacks from all enforcers
- add normal shotty?
- add autosaves
- most players don't want to melee the enforcer at the start. i should make it a grunt -- no, actually, i should just remove him.
- more ammo on hard
- i like the vore on hard in the 4-corners room
- [x] check if fog is working in videos (it isn't in demos?) = it shows up in the VODs, at least
- inky suggets a hook -> grate for the pond everyone is struggling with
- a lot of the slime ("cold water") could be regular water... or just not there, to be honest.
