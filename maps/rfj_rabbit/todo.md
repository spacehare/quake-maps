# art pass

the 'sun' is above, so don't be afraid to make tall mountains and stuff. it will only block sunlight2

artificial lights

- lamp posts
- garden stake lanterns
- sconces
- overhangs with ceiling lights

use a smaller amount of textures and let the brushes do the talking

## art todo

- [ ] lower 'bottomless' floors to 666 max
