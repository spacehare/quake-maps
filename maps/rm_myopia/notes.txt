[11:53 PM]Em3raldTig3r: Echoes has a few sections that need air-strafing to a much higher degree. Most seasoned Quake players are aware of it and know how to use it. You should be fine. 
[1:04 AM]ninjasaurus.: im pretty sure i cant make those jumps...my air-strafing skills are laughable
[1:33 AM]Inky: I wouldn't be able to do that.
It's really a matter of which target audience you have in mind.
[8:15 PM]Colossus: Well the way I see it is if you are unable to do the very basic of the regular games mechanics what would even make  you interested in playing a mod  that expanded upon those mechanics and made it more difficult in the first place
[8:36 PM]Colossus: I’m pretty sure even some of the secrets in id1 require air strafing and that came out 27 years ago
[3:11 AM]Inky: I totally stand against your statement, if ever by "very basic" you mean things like "air strafing".
It has NEVER been a very basic, but an advanced skill developed to take advantage of the game physics flaws in order to perform normally impossible moves.
Far from everyone masters such tricks. Yet everyone is welcome to enjoy Re:Mobilize whose mechanics are totally accessible to any kind of player.
[10:54 AM]Colossus: Air strafing isn’t a flaw with the  physics like I said some of the secrets in id1 require it, the concept of being able to turn in the air is very simple I mean how much does it really differ in execution turning in the air vs the ground? yeah tricks can be made hard with it but not the one being referenced in rabbits map turning in the air is a whole lot easier as a concept than wall climbing and trampolines and the stuff the remobilize maps have you do with those 
[10:55 AM]Colossus: Even as a quake speedrunner I was constantly failing on a lot of the remobilize map tricks
[10:57 AM]Colossus: Not that was a problem, it was part of the fun
