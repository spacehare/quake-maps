# random notes

- shoutouts to my various mental illnesses that kicked my ass during the production of this map
- more genuinely, shoutouts to my friends !! i'm happy that they wanted to create music and art for my map. i appreciate them; they mean the world to me. you should tell your friends how much they mean to you, too!

- some pictures i took of philly rooftops
