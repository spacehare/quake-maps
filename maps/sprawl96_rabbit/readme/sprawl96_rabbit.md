# random notes

- shoutouts to my various mental illnesses that kicked my ass during the production of this map
- more genuinely, shoutouts to my friends !! i'm happy that they wanted to create music and art for my map. i appreciate them; they mean the world to me. you should tell your friends how much they mean to you, too!

- church basement
- claustrophobic concrete hallway
- water treatment plant
- rooftop hvac unit
- half life 2 canals
- arecibo
- oni ps2 longplay
- ghost in the shell longplay
- mirror's edge longplay

other ways i got references

- i also "walked around" in google maps taking a lot of screenshots, mostly parts of Long Island (like Jamaica in Queens)
  - i also used google satellite view to get rooftop details
- some pictures i took of philly rooftops
- some [pictures of seattle](https://x.com/dgollamaart/status/1840928546187067774)
  - if this link is dead, then the twitter user deleted the post üòù

# ‚ö† notes about the secrets, if you're curious

They're all OCs! (original characters) -- (except for the bunny emoji, of course üòõ)

- Udon
  - the black microraptor with red spots on his cheeks is Ryukocha's fursona
- Io
  - the 4-eyed 4-eared hare is my fursona; they're an alien robot!
- Zif
  - the gray goblin with a long tail and their hair in a bun is Zifix, my goblinsona and current primary sona
- Finnio
  - the scary looking deep gnome necromancer is my Baldur's Gate 3 character from a multiplayer playthrough. they fuckin' love worms.
- Sprout
  - the goblin in armor, with a shield and rapier, is my D&D character (a paladin of redemption) from around 2020-2023. they were a big inspiration for me to make Zif :)
- Lavender Goblin
  - the purple stick-figure goblin with a leaf on their head is my friend August's character. August helped with ideas and feedback! ex: using verticality more, adding lighting to help guide the player and make progression more clear
