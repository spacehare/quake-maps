# notes about memories

- i played e1m1 in 2022 during QBJ1
- i watched a speedrun youtube video about e1m1 it in early 2024
- on Discord, my friend would ask me to play through my maps on stream. i did this recurring bit, where after i beat my map and got sent to `start`, i would run over to e1m1 and play a few seconds of it

i remember...

- an alcove to the left of spawn, and a raised platform to the right with green armor
- an elevator with a grunt in it
- a spiral ramp with lights and buttons
  - a tower holding a secret that you have to slope-jump into
- an outdoor section with a bridge over a river
  - a secret if you travel the river
  - big brown exterior facades
- stairs leading to the exit with lots of grunts guarding the way out
  - a secret quad to fight the grunts
- a bridge above your head, leading to a nailgun
- a bridge over acid
- scarce 45 degree angles, mostly 90 degree angles
- the speedrun video i watched mentioned how the grunts block your path a lot...
