# TRAPS !

- don't trim everything early, wait until primary art pass and then do trims if you have extra time after SFX and lighting !
- don't make everything in the art pass a round blorbo, some zigzags or fat-folds with acute angles can be OK too

# playtester feedback and demo insights

- mopey confused by rings, should i change them?
- health should respawn in final arena
- [?] lyd wants more shotty ammo before-or-during teeth forest
- [x] add way back from temple
- [x] add way back from temple arena after you win
