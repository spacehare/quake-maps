		converted to .PNG in VIDE, then to .TGA in IrfanView
Sounds		
	half-life, half-life 2

Textures
	http://khreathor.xyz/site/prototype/ for testing
	https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/makkon-textures.28/
		i extracted (in Wally), duplicated and edited the gray damaged Makkon concrete textures in paint.net to be paler for the white concrete area and to remove fullbright pixels, then packed back into a .WAD in Wally
		i also edited some filenames into a custom .WAD to get blinking tech lights
